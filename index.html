      <h2>Mel Bochner s</h2>
      <p>
        I would like to note Mel Bochners passing on February 12, 2025. He was a
        valued colleague, a brilliant interlocutor, never brought less than his
        A game to studio visits and reviews, he had a voice that brought insight
        to the conversation, and had an outstanding sense of humor. I was
        fortunate to be his colleague. Students felt fortunate for the exchange
        they shared. He never varnished his truth. May he rest in peace.
