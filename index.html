            <p>
              Hey everyone! I’ve been mapping public art in New Haven as part of
              my nonprofit project ArtAround and I’d love to invite you to join
              me or just check it out.

          <h2>Mel Bochner's</h2>
          <p>
            I would like to note Mel Bochners passing on February 12, 2025. He
            was a valued colleague, a brilliant interlocutor, never brought less
            than his A game to studio visits and reviews, he had a voice that
            brought insight to the conversation, and had an outstanding sense of
            humor. I was fortunate to be his colleague. Students felt fortunate
            for the exchange they shared. He never varnished his truth. May he
            rest in peace. —Rochelle Feinstein, Emerita Professor, School of
            Art, 1994-2017

              The School of Art is one of Yale’s Graduate & Professional Schools
              conferring MFA degrees in Graphic Design, Painting/Printmaking,
              Photography, and Sculpture; and offers undergraduate-level art
              courses to Yale College students. Our website exists as an ongoing
              collaborative experiment in digital publishing and information
              sharing. It functions as a wiki—all members of the School of Art
              community have the ability to add new, and edit most existing
              content.
